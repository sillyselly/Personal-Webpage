    <h1>About Selena!</h1> 
    <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Selena and I'm here to share a few facts about me. Sit back, relax, and learn all about me!</p>
    <img src="images/tulipsportrait.jpg" alt="Self Portrait" width="126" height="168" class="center"> <br>
    <p>This was a recent photo taken of me at the Tulip Festival in Washington. I'm currently a senior at the University of Washington, soon to receive my Bachelors of Science in Physiology. Some of my hobbies include crocheting, reading, and playing music on various instruments.</p>

    <p>The photos on the left and right are some of my crochet projects I have made. I discovered crocheting during my time in quarantine. I just found it so cool that I could create anything with just a ball of yarn and a hook. At the beginning of 2023, I made an Instagram account to document my crocheting endeavors!</p>
